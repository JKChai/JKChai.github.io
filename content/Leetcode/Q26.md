# Problem

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#9C9B97">in-place</span> such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#9C9B97">in-place</span> with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Custom Judge**:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```java
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Constraints:**

* {{< katex >}} 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104 {{</katex>}}
* {{< katex >}} -100 <= nums[i] <= 100 {{< /katex >}} 
* `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

# Solution

This problem is easy as the array is sorted which eliminates some additional steps needed to sort the array. Sorted array means that the next element in the array can be evaluated based on 1 iteration of the array reducing the time complexity needed when working with unsorted array. 

{{< hint type=note >}}
Space complexity is required to be `O(1)` which means that list should not be referenced to a variable.
{{< /hint >}}

The first step for solving this problem is to initialize a variable that act as a pointer and counter, using the first provided example, this variable is presented as below.

```py
// initialize variables
nums = [1, 1, 2]
pointer = 0
```

To evaluate if the current element is unique, we can reference the first element of the array from the pointer and iterate the array from the second element.

```py
// array index values
nums[0] --> 1
nums[1] --> 1
nums[2] --> 2

// length of array
LENGTH of nums is 3 

// pseudo code
pointer_element = nums[0] --> 1

FOR each element in nums
    starting from second element
    WHERE current element is nums[1] --> 1
ENDFOR
```

In this case, the first and second elements have the same value, thus, our pointer will need to be referenced to the second element to replace the second element by the third element. This can be completed with If-Else conditional statement.

```py
pointer_element = nums[0] --> 1

FOR each element in nums
    WHERE current element is nums[1] --> 1
    IF first_element == current_element THEN
        Do nothing
        WHICH nums[0] is equal to nums[1]
    ENDIF
ENDFOR
```

The next process continue with identifying if pointer element is the same as the current element in the iteration process. In this second iteration, the pointer element and current element do not match, therfore, the pointer element is being replaced by the current element.

```py
// second iteration process
nums = [1,1,2]
pointer = 0

pointer_element = nums[0] --> 1

FOR each element in nums
    WHERE current element is nums[2] --> 2
    IF first_element == current_element THEN
        Do nothing
    ELSE
        pointer is incremented by 1
        nums[pointer] is replaced by current element
        WHICH nums[0] is not equal to nums[2]
        THEREFORE pointer is 1 and nums[1] = nums[2] 
    ENDIF
ENDFOR
```

The result is that `nums = [1,2,2]` has the second element replaced and the pointer is now on the second element which indicates that the first `k` should be 2. For the code process, this can be completed by adding 1 to pointer and return the result. For more information about this logic process, please review `Attempt 1`.

This attempt is basically reviewing the logic that was mentioned in the `Solution` section. The idea is to use a pointer as a reference to replace the next array element with a unique element. 

```py
## use pointer
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        pointer = 0 ## set pointer         
        ## loop from second element and ends at last second element
        for idx in range(1, len(nums)):
            ## do nothing when current element is not unique
            if nums[idx] == nums[pointer]:
                pass
            ## replace the next k element by unique element
            else:
                pointer += 1 ## pointer move up for next index
                nums[pointer] = nums[idx] ## replace for first k

        print(nums) ## for personal evaluation only
        return pointer+1 ## make pointer a counter

## personal evaluation
s = Solution()
print(f"s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2]): k={s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2])}")
print(f"s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]): k={s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4])}")

## output
[1, 2, 2]
s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2]): k=2
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]): k=5
```

This attempt is basically the same as the first attempt but cleaner. 

```py
## use pointer
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        pointer = 0 ## set pointer 

        ## loop from second element and ends at last second element
        for idx in range(1, len(nums)):
            ## replace the next k element by unique element
            if nums[idx] != nums[pointer]:
                pointer += 1 ## pointer move up for next index
                nums[pointer] = nums[idx] ## replace for first k

        print(nums) ## for personal evaluation only
        return pointer+1 ## make pointer a counter

## personal evaluation
s = Solution()
print(f"s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2]): k={s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2])}")
print(f"s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]): k={s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4])}")

## output
[1, 2, 2]
s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2]): k=2
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]): k=5
```

This solution looks at Python built-in data structure `set()` which takes only unique values and return as a map data structure. The data structure is converted back to a list for submission. Python unique data structure might make this approach the best solution.

{{< hint type=WARNING title=ATTENTION >}}
Leetcode is not able to evaluate `nums` when using `set()` data structure to overwrite `nums` array, because `nums` need to be replaced based on index replacement as presented in the `Custom Judge` criteria. 
{{< /hint >}}

```py
## use set to filter unique values
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        nums = list(set(nums))
        print(nums) ## for personal evaluation only
        return len(nums)

## personal evaluation
s = Solution()
print(f"s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2]): k={s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2])}")
print(f"s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]): k={s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4])}")

## output
[1, 2]
s.removeDuplicates([1,1,2]): k=2
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
s.removeDuplicates([0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]): k=5
