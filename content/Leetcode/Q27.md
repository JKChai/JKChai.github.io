# Problem

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#9C9B97">in-place</span>. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do not **allocate** extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#9C9B97">in-place</span> with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```java
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Constraints:**

* {{< katex >}} 0 <= nums.length <= 100 {{</katex>}}
* {{< katex >}} 0 <= nums[i] <= 50 {{< /katex >}} 
* {{< katex >}} 0 <= val <= 100 {{</katex>}}

# Solution

This question is a fairly easy question and there are couple of methods that can be used to solve this problem with Python.

There are 2 inputs, a list `nums` and an integer `val`, and there should be 1 output, an `int` type. However, Leetcode also evaluates the last output of the first `k` elements from the final `nums` list after removing `val` values from the list. This mean that Leetcode final evaluations for this problem is based on the output integer and final `nums` list values. We will explain more in details.

Using the first example as demo, `nums` list consists of 4 elements.

```py
[3, 2, 2, 3]
```

In this 4 elements list, `val` is 3 indicates that element 3 from the list will need to be removed and in Python, removing the element will automatically have the list contracted, which are not the case for languages such as Java and C++. However, the question does not care about the final length of the list but just the first `k` elements of the list.

```py
## first element is 3; therefore, remove
[2, 2, 3]

## second and third element are retained & last element is 3; therefore, removed
[2, 2]
```

The final output is length `2` and `[2, 2]` list.

{{< hint type=note >}}
Space complexity is required to be `O(1)` which means that list should not be referenced to a variable.
{{< /hint >}}

## Attempt 1

This attempt is straightforward by just looping through each element to check if current element matches `val`. This method does not reduce the length of list but will moved the element values to the front `k`.

{{< hint type=note >}}
`print(f"nums: {nums}")` is for reference only by showing the list structure because Leetcode will evaluate `nums` on-fly; therefore, final structure of `nums` is the key to pass Leetcode submission. Remove this line when copy and run in Leetcode environment.

## Brute-Force Approach
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:
        k = 0 ## count nums of elements
        ## O(n) time complexity 
        for idx in range(len(nums)):
            ## increment k if not match vals
            if nums[idx] != val:
                nums[k] = nums[idx]
                k += 1
        print(f"nums: {nums}")
        return k

## personal evaluation
s = Solution()
print(f"s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k={s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3)}")
print(f"s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k={s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2)}")

## output
nums: [2, 2, 2, 3]
s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k=2
nums: [0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 2]
s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k=5
```

## Attempt 2

Using Python built-in remove method to remove the element from list `nums`, note that `remove()` will remove the elements from the list, thus, reducing the length of the list. Therefore, indexing will need to take consideration of element being moved from 1 position to another position.

For example,
```
## starting with this small example
nums -> [3, 2, 2, 3]
val -> 3

## first loop
idx -> 0
len(nums) -> 4
nums[0] -> 3

if nums[idx] == val: ## matches

[3, 2, 2, 3].remove(3) -> [2, 2, 3] 

## second loop
nums -> [2, 2, 3]
idx -> 0
len(nums) -> 3
nums[0] -> 2

if nums[idx] == val: ## NO matches

idx += 1 -> 1

## third loop
nums -> [2, 2, 3]
idx -> 1
len(nums) -> 3
nums[1] -> 2

if nums[idx] == val: ## NO matches

idx += 1 -> 2

## fourth loop
nums -> [2, 2, 3]
idx -> 2
len(nums) -> 3
nums[2] -> 3

if nums[idx] == val: ## matches

[2, 2, 3].remove(3) -> [2, 2] 

## final output
len(nums) -> 2
nums -> [2, 2]
```

```py
## Using remove method
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:
        idx = 0 ## initialize list index
        
        ## complexity of O(n) using loop rather than iteration
        ## as len(nums) will change after each while-loop
        while idx < len(nums):
            ## remove element that matches val
            if nums[idx] == val:
                nums.remove(val)
            ## only increment index when matching failed
            else:
                idx += 1
        print(f"nums: {nums}")
        return len(nums)

## personal evaluation
s = Solution()
print(f"s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k={s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3)}")
print(f"s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k={s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2)}")

## output
nums: [2, 2]
s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k=2
nums: [0, 1, 3, 0, 4]
s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k=5
```

## Attempt 3

`pop()` is a built-in list method `dir(list)` and uses similar concept as `remove()` method does when removing items; the differences is that `pop()` relies on index while `remove()` relies on element for removing list elements. To make this code shorter and easy, the loop starts from the end of list index position and move through the first index of the list. Think of this as moving pointer from the end to beginning.

```py
## using pop method
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:
        ## looping from the end of index
        ## ease index count
        for idx in range(len(nums), 0, -1):
            ## range(include, exclude, steps); true index matches idx - 1
            idx = idx - 1 
            ## pop away when element matches val
            if nums[idx] == val:
                nums.pop(idx)
        print(f"nums: {nums}")
        return len(nums)

## personal evaluation
s = Solution()
print(f"s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k={s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3)}")
print(f"s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k={s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2)}")

## output
nums: [2, 2]
s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k=2
nums: [0, 1, 3, 0, 4]
s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k=5
```

### Leetcode Result

## Attempt 4

The last attempt uses list comprehension. As stated in [Python performance tips](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Loops), list comprehension shall perform much faster than loop when the list is small. Also, list comprehension should take lower memory than a loop to process due to elements being stored in memory as hash values. For those who are familiar with Spark framwork, this can be think of as Spark lazy loading operation.

{{< hint type=WARNING title=ATTENTION >}}
Leetcode is not able to evaluate `nums` when using list comprehension. The debugger in Leetcode seems to suggest that Leetcode has been evaluated `nums` as an iterator object through out the loop; therefore, takes only the input `nums` as submission rather than finalize `nums` for submission. Thus, this will not work in Leetcode but the solutions is correct.

```py
## list comprehension approach
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:
        ## use list comprehension & len method for O(1) space complexity
        nums = [x for x in nums if x != val]
        print(f"nums: {nums}")
        return len(nums) 

## personal evaluation
s = Solution()
print(f"s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k={s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3)}")
print(f"s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k={s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2)}")

## output
nums: [2, 2]
s.removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3): k=2
nums: [0, 1, 3, 0, 4]
s.removeElement([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], 2): k=5
```
