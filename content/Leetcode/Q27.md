# Problem

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#9C9B97">in-place</span>. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do not **allocate** extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#9C9B97">in-place</span> with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```java
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Constraints:**

* {{< katex >}} 0 <= nums.length <= 100 {{</katex>}}
* {{< katex >}} 0 <= nums[i] <= 50 {{< /katex >}} 
* {{< katex >}} 0 <= val <= 100 {{</katex>}}

# Solution

This question is a fairly easy question and there are couple of methods that can be used to solve this problem with Python.

There are 2 inputs, a list `nums` and an integer `val`, and there should be 1 output, an `int` type. However, Leetcode also evaluates the last output of the first `k` elements from the final `nums` list after removing `val` values from the list. This mean that Leetcode final evaluations for this problem is based on the output integer and final `nums` list values. We will explain more in details.

Using the first example as demo, `nums` list consists of 4 elements.

```py
[3, 2, 2, 3]
```

In this 4 elements list, `val` is 3 indicates that element 3 from the list will need to be removed and in Python, removing the element will automatically have the list contracted, which are not the case for languages such as Java and C++.

```py
## first element is 3; therefore, remove
[2, 2, 3]

## second and third element are retained & last element is 3; therefore, removed
[2, 2]
```

The final output is length `2` and `[2, 2]` list.

{{< hint type=note>}}
Space complexity is required to be `O(1)` which means that list should not be referenced to a variable.

## Attempt 1

```py
## Brute-Force Approach
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        ## loop all elements
        for idx in range(len(nums)):
            ## when the list item is the value
            if val != nums[idx]:
                ## and if the next index value is nt out of range
                nums[i] = nums[idx]
                i += 1 
        return len(nums) 

```

## Attempt 4

```py
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:
        ## use list comprehension & len method for O(1) space complexity
        result = [x for x in nums if x != val]
        return result 
```
