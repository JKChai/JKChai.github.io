# Congratulation ðŸš€ on Landing ðŸ›¬ to Our Site !! ðŸ›¸

<div align='left'>
This site currently contains problem solving attempts on <a src="https://leetcode.com">Leetcode</a> questions for the purpose of collaborating and practicing, however, both authors envision a better site that shall contain resources covering data science learning techniques and posts covering beginner friendly solutions and knowledge for the peers. This site is currently in experimental phase and more are expected to be added. These expected items are referred as the current backlogs, presented below, and the authors hope to be able to complete these asap to make this site a fully functional site for educational and development purposes.
