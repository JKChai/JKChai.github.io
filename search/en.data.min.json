[{"id":0,"href":"/","title":"üëã Hello World !!","parent":"","content":" Congratulation üöÄ on Landing üõ¨ to Our Site !! üõ∏ This site currently contains problem solving attempts on Leetcode questions for the purpose of collaborating and practicing, however, both authors envision a better site that shall contain resources covering data science learning techniques and posts covering beginner friendly solutions and knowledge for the peers. This site is currently in experimental phase and more are expected to be added. These expected items are referred as the current backlogs, presented below, and the authors hope to be able to complete these asap to make this site a fully functional site for educational and development purposes. About us Leetcode BACKLOGS (For Possible Further Site Improvement) DS \u0026amp; Algo Contents Continue to add more data structures and algorithms contents from Leetcode for peers to reference and learn. Comment Box Provide commenting tools for peers to provide feedbacks and interaction with the posts to help improve the current solutions and for futher site and content improvements. Language Support Provide Mandarin as second language support for peers to be able to study and work in bilingual mode. Python Knowledge Stop Answer common Python questions that can be found from Google, Stack Overflow, etc. to provide a one-time stop for peers without having to read through different blogs and articles to obtain the solution they need. DS Knowledge Hub Provide articles and notes that cover fundamental tools use in the Data Science realm which might cover descriptive, diadnosis, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. Programming Language Intended to provide SQL \u0026amp; C++ knowledge support for peers that relies on these tools for job search, interview, projects, etc. This site is proudly built with HUGO using Geekdocs theme hosted on GitHub.
